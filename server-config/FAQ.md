tilde.city server setup FAQ
===========================

Why cloudatcost.com?
--------------------
A friend of mine turned me on to this Canadian company - they offer VPSes for a
one-time-fee-only! They're not high-end, but they do the trick, and this seemed
like the perfect fit for a tilde.* type site.

Why nginx?
----------
It's small, fast, low-footprint, and just all around better than Apache if you
want a lean, mean, web serving machine. It can be a bit weird to configure the
first time, but trust me, you'll like it!
