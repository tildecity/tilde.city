<p>Perplexed about this whole tilde.city thing?  Got your account but not sure
	what to do with it? We're here to help!  This page collects tips and tricks
	for making the most of your tilde.city account, in the form of another FAQ,
	some links, and basically whatever we stick on it. :)</p>

	<dt>What's my password?</dt>
	<dd>You don't have one! Or if you do, I don't know it - you should set a 
		passphrase for you SSH key, and then the key is all you need for
		authentication.  Public key authentication is not subject to brute force
		attacks like password authentication, so your account will be safer.</dd>
				
	<dt>Why is my account at &lt;somenumber&gt;.tilde.city?</dt>
	<dd>Didn't you read that scalability part?! :)  I'm planning for the future
		with multiple hosts.  But don't worry, you only have to remember it for
		login (and hopefully soon you won't have to do even that) - your web
		presence will work as just tilde.city/~you, and you can receive e-mail
		from other tilde.city members at you@tilde.city and it'll just work.</dd>
