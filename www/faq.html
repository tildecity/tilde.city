<center><h1>~~~ tilde.city Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) ~~~</h1></center>

<dl>
	<dt>Who runs this thing?</dt>
	<dd>Tim Wilde, aka
		<a href="mailto:twilde@tilde.city">twilde@tilde.city</a>.</dd>
	
	<dt>What can I do with it?</dt>
	<dd>Lots of things!  A better question is what can't you do with it?  Also
		lots of things!  Such as:
		<ul>
			<li>SPAM (or send any e-mail outside of tilde.city, in fact!)</li>
			<li>Attempt to hack into any systems, internal or external</li>
			<li>Charge fees for / re-sell access</li>
			<li>Give away access to friends - just have them request their 
				own account!</li>
			<li>Send tons of outbound network traffic.  Outbound ports are
				disabled by default, send me a note if you want one opened.</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>How much does it cost?</dt>
	<dd>Nothing! Zero, zilch, nada. However, I reserve the right to terminate
		the service or your account if you do something naughty, and provide no
		uptime or reliability guarantees.</dd>
		
	<dt>But, but, you said your goal is for high-reliability and
		scalability!</dt>
	<dd>Very observant, you're right!  That is our goal, but this is free here!
		I can't guarantee anything - I'll do my best, but that's really it.  If
		a community forms and steps up, things will get better.  That's up to
		all of you!</dd>
		
	<dt>Okay, how do I sign up?</dt>
	<dd>I'm glad you asked! Just create yourself an SSH public key (<a
		href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">GitHub has
		a great article on how!</a>) and e-mail it to <a
		href="mailto:twilde@tilde.city">twilde@tilde.city</a>!  If you tell me a
		little about yourself I'd love to hear it, but it's not necessary.</dd>
		
	<dt>Why are you doing this?</dt>
	<dd>I'm a systems engineer by day, and a friend of mine at work fired up
		another tilde.club clone (check him out at
		<a href="http://tilde.camp/">tilde.camp</a>!), so I decided to give it a
	    shot as well.  I didn't like the "we're not accepting new users" thing
		at tilde.club, so I decided to use my systems engineering experience to
		try to design my version scalably.  We'll see whether or not I actually
		manage to make that work. :)</dd>
