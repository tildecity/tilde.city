Welcome to [tilde.city](http://tilde.city/)'s code/info/everything repository!
We're Yet Another Clone of the tilde.club idea, with reliability, scalabity,
and transparency as our primary goals. That's right, it's a free service that
will actually try very hard to be up and running as much as humanly (and
digitally) possible! That said, there's no guarantees.  But we'll try!  And we 
welcome help!  Check out the site, check out this repo, and join us!

All donations will be publicly visible on the blockchain, and we'll
document what they're used for as they get spent away!
