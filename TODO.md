If you're interested in doing any of these things, feel free to request an
account and do them in your own directory, or fork and send a pull request on
GitHub to implement changes, or talk to me about becoming an administrator.  All
help welcome, and distribution of donations will be provable and public via the
Bitcoin blockchain!
